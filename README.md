# Sense/Net Authentication server

SN-Auth is a lightweight authentication server implementation for Sense/Net repositories.

The authentication server consists of two parts:
- An API through which the client can log in/register etc. (recommended for custom UI)
- A built-in UI that you do not need to implement in your application.

The description of the API endpoints can be found in the swagger documentation.
